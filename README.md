## Notes

The hardest things to point out was the struggle I had to play the virtual box due to just be using verion 5 
instead of 4.3 and to learn swift (even though it looks and works a little like java, many details change).
Also had a little problem with the segues because first I thought I had to use delegates but later on learned
there was an easier way.
